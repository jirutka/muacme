:version: 0.4.0

This a convenient wrapper for the ACMEv2 client https://github.com/ndilieto/uacme[uacme] that provides a ready-to-go solution for a cron-based periodic renewal of an arbitrary number of TLS certificates.


== Requirements

* https://github.com/ndilieto/uacme[uacme]
* http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html[POSIX-sh] compatible shell with `pipefail` (e.g. Busybox ash, ZSH, bash, …)
* `grep`, `sed`, `tr`, `xargs` (BSD, Busybox or GNU)
* `openssl` command (should work with OpenSSL and LibreSSL)

httpd-challenge-hook.sh:

* `busybox httpd`
* `start-stop-daemon` from OpenRC


== Installation

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
wget https://github.com/{gh-name}/archive/v{version}/{proj-name}-{version}.tar.gz
tar -xzf {proj-name}-{version}.tar.gz
cd {proj-name}-{version}
make install


== Usage

See the help section in link:muacme#L3[muacme] (or run `muacme -h`) and comments in link:muacme.conf[].

Note that you have to create an ACME account first (see https://ndilieto.github.io/uacme/uacme.html#_usage[uacme(1)] for more information):

[source]
uacme -v -c /etc/ssl/uacme new [EMAIL]


== Examples

* Issue a certificate for domain _example.org_ with alternative name _www.example.org_ (and using options specified in the configuration file _/etc/muacme/muacme.conf_):
+
[source, sh]
muacme issue example.org www.example.org

* Issue a certificate for each domain listed in the given file (one per line with optional alternative names separated by a space) for which we don’t have one already.
Domains for which we already have a certificate will be ignored.
+
[source,sh]
muacme issue -F domains.list

* Renew all certificates that are close to their expiration:
+
[source, sh]
muacme renew all

* Renew certificate for domain _example.org_ even if it’s too soon:
+
[source, sh]
muacme renew -f example.org

* A renew hook for reloading nginx on a system using OpenRC:
+
[source, sh]
#!/bin/sh
/etc/init.d/nginx --ifstarted --quiet reload

* A cron script _/etc/periodic/weekly/muacme-renew-all_:
+
[source, sh]
#!/bin/sh
exec muacme renew -l all


== httpd-challenge-hook.sh

link:httpd-challenge-hook.sh[] is a hook script for the https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge[HTTP-01 challenge] that automatically starts https://busybox.net[busybox] httpd server on port 80 to serve the key authorization for the challenge verification and stops it right after it’s done.

The complete process of renewal looks like this:

. A cron job starts `muacme renew -l all`.
. `muacme` invokes `uacme` for each certificate found in _/etc/ssl/uacme/_.
. `uacme` checks the certificate expiration date; if it’s near expiration (parameter `days` in link:muacme.conf[]), uacme initiates HTTP-01 challenge.
. `uacme` executes link:httpd-challenge-hook.sh[] script that writes the validation file for Let’s Encrypt into a temporary directory and *starts a webserver* (`busybox httpd`) *on port 80* to serve this file.
. Let’s Encrypt retrieves the validation file from `++http://<domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>++`.
. `uacme` sends CSR to Let’s Encrypt and retrieves the signed certificate.
. `uacme` executes link:httpd-challenge-hook.sh[] script again to remove the verification file and *stop the webserver*.
. `uacme` executes your link:renew-hook.sh[] script to reload services etc.
